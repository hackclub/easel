Eia64 is an interpreted language that draws inspiration from the lovely syntax of Kotlin and many other languages like Go.

## Main highlights

- Standard library
- Importing external classes
- Class structure for object support
- Emphasis on strict typing
- Mutable / Immutable variables
- Functions and overloading
- Access modifiers
- Anonymous Lambdas
- Decent support for tracing errors along with try-catch
- Live trace ability — see how your code flows while it runs

## You lazy?

If you are afraid of Git, you can try out our SSH version! 👀

```bash
ssh -p 2121 hackclub.app
```

and look what you got! You can try out Eia without installing it. 😎
